# ‚ö† ‚ò£ üê¶ Currently working on huge refactor

The entire internal structure is being reorganized/rewritten. So commits are gonna be chunky and weird.

## Refactor notes

- Player.runStream and getFfmpegStream: Retry logic is definitely flawed, as it doesn't catch playback failures in the middle of a song.
  - A solution to this would be to make the retries happen whenever Djs's player comes idle. Check if the current song has played it's entire amount, if it hasn't retry until retries exhausted
- Forgot to handle behaviour when skipping last song in queue
- Also I just bricked my whole console by logging ffmpeg output, so maybe I wanna prevent that happening somehow?

## Bugs

- Unhandled stale media source links (_has_ been an issue now)
- Crash in the middle of queuing a playlist leads to it queueing incompletely
- Missing audio files' duration (direct file source) (_maybe_ won't fix)
- Corrupted queue storage prevents startup
- Weird behaviour when seeking from persistence
- Actually just weird seeking in general, the beginning of songs may be cut off

## Planned?

- Retry system on play (and give up)
- Automatically leave when idled for too long
- Proper error handling, instead of failing silently
- /np and /q shorthands
- Distributed Queue (song requests evenly split between requesters in queue)
- Live Player Message
- Playlist saving
- Repeat one / Repeat playlist
- Permission system

## Done :)

- Seeking
- Better /now-playing
- Better /queue
- Moving songs in queue
- Add `position` option to /play
- Pausing
- Chapters
- Persistence-ish
- /history

## Fixed

- There's no /search lol
- Off by one error in /queue (3 pages when there's 20 elements in 2)
- Not properly saving last connected vc for persistence (including being disconnected)
- /play always queueing in position 0 (current song)
- /skip is just completely broken
- Skipping last song in queue is broken
- Sources that only deliver video don't work
- Sometimes attempt to parse incomplete ytdl output
- Missing /join command to join or change voice channel
- Debounce persistence storage saving
