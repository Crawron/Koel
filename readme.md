## Working on
- Different song sources
	- Properly handling playlists 
	- Add source to metadata

## Bugs
- Skipping last song in queue is broken
- Missing audio files' duration (_maybe_ won't fix)
- Off by one error in /queue (3 pages when there's 20 elements in 2)

## Planned?
- Better /queue and /now-playing
- /np and /q shorthands
- Pausing
- Seeking
- Moving songs in queue
- Chapters
- Distributed Queue (song requests evenly split between requesters in queue)
- Live Player Message
- .env.example
